# Corona_Data_EDA_project
# Coronavirus Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores a coronavirus dataset containing 36,563 rows and 8 columns. The dataset includes daily reports on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from different countries and regions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **Province**: The province or state in the country.
- **Country_Region**: The country or region affected.
- **Latitude**: Geographical latitude of the location.
- **Longitude**: Geographical longitude of the location.
- **Date**: The date of the report.
- **Confirmed**: Total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- **Deaths**: Total number of COVID-19 related deaths.
- **Recovered**: Total number of recovered cases.

## Project Tasks and Insights

The following analyses were performed:

1. **Checked for NULL values** in the dataset to ensure data integrity.
2. **Total number of rows** in the dataset: 36,563 records.
3. **Start and end dates** of the dataset were identified.
4. **Number of months** covered by the dataset.
5. **Monthly averages** for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
6. **Minimum values** for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries per year.
7. **Confirmed, deaths, and recoveries per month**: Calculated totals for each month.
8. **Top 5 countries with the highest number of confirmed cases**.

## Tools Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**: Used for querying the data and performing the exploratory analysis.

## Further Analysis

Here are some additional analyses that can be performed on the dataset:
1. **Trend analysis**: Visualize the daily, monthly, and yearly trends for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
2. **Geospatial analysis**: Map the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by region and country.
3. **Case fatality rate**: Calculate the case fatality rate for each country and region over time.
4. **Impact of interventions**: Analyze the effect of government interventions (e.g., lockdowns) on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
5. **Correlation analysis**: Investigate correlations between the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and geographical factors (latitude, longitude).
